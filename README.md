> Task: Build a Dynamic One-Page Website with React

Your task is to create a dynamic one-page website using React, which includes the following features:

Website Layout:

Design a simple, clean one-page website that can optionally display a banner. The banner's visibility should be controllable. 
Frontend Countdown Display: Implement a countdown timer on the banner, displayed as a reverse clock, that shows the remaining time before the banner disappears.
Internal Dashboard:

Implement an internal dashboard that allows the following controls:
Banner On/Off: Toggle the visibility of the banner on the main website.
Banner Description: Update the content of the banner's text.
Banner Timer: Set a timer to control how long the banner is displayed. Please make sure in the frontend, there should be a reverse clock showing the countdown. 
Banner Link: Add a clickable link to the banner, directing users to a specified URL
Database Integration: Use MySQL to store the banner's content, including the description, timer settings, and link. The dashboard should retrieve and update this information in the database.
